  <h2>The Begining</h2>
  <p>For more than 50 years, Ovidiu's Hotel  has been established as a leader in luxury hospitality, and has a rich and proud history. Our mission, ‘to delight our guests each and every day’ began with the opening of our flagship property, The Mandarin, in 1963 in Hong Kong. The hotel, which was the tallest building on the island when it opened, soon built up an enviable reputation for service excellence, and instantly became a historic landmark – a status it still holds today. 
  </p>
    <p>In order to bring our individual brand of acclaimed luxury hospitality to a wider market we began extending our reach, embarking on a growth trajectory to establish our award-winning brand in key city and resort destinations around the globe. In 1987 we launched our first US property in San Francisco, and in the mid-1990s, we purchased our London flagship. </p>
